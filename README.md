Boston House Price Prediction
Welcome to my Boston House Price Prediction project! This project involves predicting housing prices in the Boston area using various machine learning techniques. Here are the key details:

Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using supervised machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and more, which are used to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
Models Used: Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), XGBoost Regressor etc.
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error, R-squared value.
Tools and Libraries: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas, NumPy.
Results
The final model achieved an R-squared value of 82.7% and a Mean Squared Error of 0.00963 on the test dataset, indicating the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
